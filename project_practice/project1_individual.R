#Visualize the distribution of car classes (class variable) with a bar plot and determine the
#proportion of each car type. Identify the most common car type.





#Engine Size and Fuel Efficiency
 #Plot a scatterplot of engine displacement (displ) vs. highway fuel efficiency (hwy).
 #Describe any observable trend. Does a larger engine size generally correlate with lower fuel efficiency?
  


#Analyzing Drive Type
#Create subsets for each drive type (drv), i.e., f (front-wheel), r (rear-wheel), and 4 (4wd).
# Compare the average highway fuel efficiency (hwy) across these subsets using mean() and sd().
# Identify which drive type tends to have the highest and lowest fuel efficiency.



#Exploring Fuel Economy by Cylinder Count
# Visualize the distribution of city fuel economy (cty) across cars with different numbers of cylinders (cyl) using a boxplot.
# Determine if thereâ€™s a noticeable trend in fuel efficiency with increasing cylinder count.




#Factors Influencing Fuel Efficiency
#Investigate which variables might influence fuel efficiency (cty and hwy) the most.
# Use appropriate visualizations (scatterplots, boxplots) to examine relationships between class, displ, cyl, and fuel efficiency.
# Summarize your findings and suggest possible reasons for the relationships observed.
